Description: Use archive/tar instead of dmcgowan/go-tar
 It seems that dmcgowan/go-tar is basically ahead of archive/tar, and its
 purpose is to make the latest tar implementation available to older version
 of go.
 .
 We don't really care since the version of go shipped right now is v1.10,
 which already provides everything needed.
